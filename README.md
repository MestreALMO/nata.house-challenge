## About
The [challenge](https://www.notion.so/Technical-test-nata-house-b41bd08b949d4cf194a18322b28bf09b):

Using the Star Wars API available at [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/), your application must return, for a given user-inputted distance in mega lights (MGLT), how many stops each ship has to make in order to complete a journey.

All the necessary information to complete this task is available on the linked website, which contains the API documentation. The following is an example with the **correct** response when the user inputs a distance of 1,000,000 (one million) mega lights:

```
Millennium Falcon: 9
Y-wing: 74
...
Rebel Transport: 11
...
```

## Prerequisites
To run in Windows 10 you need to install some tools, like: NodeJS, Chocolatey and more. [here](https://github.com/MestreALMO/React-Requires-To-Run-Windows-) is how to install all of it.
<br/>


## Running
Access the root of the project with a terminal, don't forget to run ```yarn``` if it is the first time running the project, then run the code:
```
yarn start
```
With that the project will be running! 
<br />You can access it with ```http://localhost:3000/```
